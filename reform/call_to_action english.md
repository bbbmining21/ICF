DECLARATION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE INTERCHAIN FOUNDATION LEADERSHIP: A CALL TO ACTION 

### 1. 	**PREAMBLE**

1.1 	**ESTABLISHMENT** 
WHEREAS, the Interchain Foundation (ICF) was established on March 07, 2017, as a Swiss foundation (Stiftung) under CHE-199.569.367; and 

1.2 	**LEGAL CONTEXT** 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Swiss law, a Stiftung may be formed solely for a specific, not-for-profit purpose and is subject to regulatory supervision by the Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (FSAF/ESA); and 

1.3 	**MANDATED PURPOSE** 
WHEREAS, the ICF's mandated purpose is "promoting and developing new technologies and applications, especially in the fields of new open and decentralized software architectures. A dominating but not exclusive focus is set on the promotion and development of the Cosmos Network, the Polkadot Protocol and the related technologies as well as to conduct the necessary fundraising"; and 

1.4 	**FUNDRAISING** 
WHEREAS, the ICF conducted an ICO for ATOM in April 2017, raising $17 million, to fund its endowment; and 

WHEREAS, the Cosmos Plan, as cited in the ATOM ICO Terms and Conditions, defines the ICF's purpose, and creates a fiduciary duty to use the raised funds for: 
  
  a. Conducting the aforementioned fundraiser; 
  
  b. Contracting for the development of Cosmos Essential Software and Services (CESS); 
  
  c. Fostering a community around CESS; and 

1.5 	**ATOM ALLOCATION** 
WHEREAS, the ICF was given 20,277,188.49 ATOM, 10% of the Genesis supply, with the mandate to use these tokens for the interconnected purposes of the Cosmos Plan and its mandate established via charter; and 

1.6 	**BENEFICIARIES** 
WHEREAS, ATOM ICO investors, token holders, validators, developers, and contributors who participate in Cosmos Hub governance are recognized as general beneficiaries of the ICF's activities, and hereafter collectively referred to as "stakeholders"; and 

1.7 	**FIDUCIARY DUTY**
WHEREAS, the ICF is entrusted with a singular stewardship role, evidenced by two key events: the ICO of ATOM tokens and the subsequent allocation of ATOM tokens at Genesis; and 
WHEREAS, these events establish an ongoing fiduciary duty to execute its mandated purpose through initiatives that directly benefit ATOM, with programs and strategic initiatives that align with the stipulated "dominating" focus on the Cosmos Hub and Network as per its founding documents; and 

1.8 	**RESPONSIBILITY** 
WHEREAS, the ICF bears the critical responsibility of coordinating distributed development for decentralized Cosmos architectures, necessitating efficient resource allocation, good governance, legal compliance, and stakeholder engagement; and 

### 2. 	**GROUNDS FOR NO CONFIDENCE AND CALL TO ACTION** 
WHEREAS, the ICF has demonstrably failed to: 
 
  a. Execute its mandated purpose; 
 
  b. Perform its fiduciary and legal duties; 
 
  c. Fulfill its obligations to stakeholders; and 

WHEREAS, the grounds for the declaration of no confidence and the "Call to Action" include, inter alia: 

2.1 	**DEVIATION FROM MANDATED PURPOSE** 
WHEREAS, prima facie evidence suggests deviation and/or impermissible mutation of the ICF’s mandated purpose; and 
WHEREAS, such deviation or mutation constitutes an ultra vires act, exceeding the scope of the ICF's authority as a Swiss foundation, and may contravene Article 86a of the Swiss Civil Code, which stipulates that a foundation's purpose may only be amended under strictly limited circumstances and with the approval of the FSAF; and 

2.2 	**BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY** 
WHEREAS, the ICF has observably failed to uphold its fiduciary duties to ATOM investors and the Cosmos Hub, demonstrating indifference to the vital support ATOM still requires; and 
WHEREAS, the failure to prioritize ATOM, despite having received ATOM, BTC, and ETH tokens to fund its endowment and key activities, represents a fundamental breach of trust, dereliction of purpose and its core responsibilities; and 

2.3 	**GOVERNANCE FAILURES** 
WHEREAS, lack of competence and expertise in foundation management has led to governance deficiencies evidenced by: 
 
  a. Allegations of anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant position by members of the Foundation Council (FC), potentially violating applicable competition laws and contravening principles of fair governance; 

  b. Governance instability manifested in the resignation and replacement of two FC Presidents within an eleven-month period;
 
  c. Inadequate implementation of checks and balances, and ineffective oversight mechanisms; and 

2.4 	**CONFLICTS OF INTEREST** 
WHEREAS, unmitigated conflicts of interest (COIs) impair its critical functions in resource allocation and decision-making, particularly affecting grants, vendor agreements, investments, and token delegations; and 
WHEREAS, the ICF's internal controls exhibit inadequate implementations for: 
  
  a. Preventing, detecting, and correcting self-dealing; 
 
  b. Safeguards against improper influences affecting FC and Board of Management decisions; 
 
  c. Proper disclosure and recusal procedures; and 

2.5 	**LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY** 
WHEREAS, the ICF asserts comprehensive statutory reporting to the FSAF, including "ordinary audits," yet the confidential nature of these filings precludes stakeholder verification; and 
WHEREAS, the ICF's compliance with the FSAF is insufficient to satisfy its transparency and accountability obligations to stakeholders; and for nearly eight years, the ICF has shown a pattern of non-disclosure and obfuscation, resulting in a substantial and potentially incurable information asymmetry; and 
WHEREAS, this calculated withholding of information appears strategically motivated to frustrate stakeholder demands for reform and oversight; and these actions have created a systemic obstruction of information that disadvantages stakeholders, while compromising the long-term viability of the Cosmos project; and 

2.6 	**FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT** 
WHEREAS, the ICF has shown indications of imprudent Treasury management characterized by funding disruptions, likely due to inadequate risk management, diversification and liquidity management strategies; and 
WHEREAS, the ICF's reporting on its assets fails to meet reasonable disclosure standards, lacking comprehensive inventory of fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and other financial instruments; and 
WHEREAS, the ICF has failed to provide stakeholders with timely and adequate reporting on significant changes in various assets and their management strategies on a year-over-year basis, not only obstructs accountability but violates its duty to inform as a not-for-profit purpose foundation and fiduciary; and 
WHEREAS, concerns regarding potential misuse of funds, including allegations of embezzlement, which if substantiated, would violate civil and criminal laws; and 

2.7 	**EROSION OF STAKEHOLDER TRUST** 
WHEREAS, all of the above enumerated concerns extend beyond ethical considerations and/or violations of the ICF charter, but may also possibly contravene Swiss Civil Code, Swiss Code of Obligations, Swiss Criminal Code, and Swiss Foundation laws; and

WHEREAS, these urgent issues necessitates immediate and decisive stakeholder action; 

### 3. 	CALL TO ACTION 
NOW, THEREFORE, We, the stakeholders of the Cosmos Hub, being duly empowered and justified by the foregoing, do hereby resolve to address the ICF’s systemic failures through the following: 

3.1 	**DECLARATION OF NO CONFIDENCE** 
We hereby **DECLARE** formally our vote of no confidence in the ICF Foundation Council (FC) leadership; 

3.2 	**PETITION FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REPORTS** 
We hereby **PETITION** the ICF to publish Comprehensive Annual Reports (hereinafter "Reports") for fiscal years 2017-2023, as follows: 

3.2.1 Individual Reports for each fiscal year; no consolidated Reports.

*Areas not covered and why 

*Alternative evaluation measures for uncovered areas 
 
  c. Relevant audit findings, as deemed appropriate by ICF 
 
  d. Additional information for comprehensive understanding of ICF operations. 

3.2.3 In cases where certain information cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality constraints, the ICF shall: 

a. Clearly state the nature of the information that cannot be disclosed 

b. Provide the legal or regulatory basis for such non-disclosure 

c. Offer any permissible summary or redacted version of the information that can be shared. 
This comprehensive reporting structure ensures transparency regarding the ICF's operations, financial status, and governance practices, while also providing clarity on the scope of the requested annual Reports and any limitations in available information. The inclusion of relevant audit findings, at the ICF's discretion, further promotes transparency while respecting necessary confidentiality.
