AUDIT SCOPE REFERENCE DOCUMENT 

1. 	PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

1.1 	This Audit Scope Reference Document (hereinafter “Document”) constitutes an integral component of the Call to Action outlined in the Cosmos Hub governance signaling proposal: “Declaration of No Confidence in the Interchain Foundation Leadership – Call to Action”. 

1.2 	The Document shall be construed in conjunction with Section 3.2 of the aforementioned proposal’s Call to Action, which petitions the ICF to publish Comprehensive Annual Reports for fiscal years 2017- 2023. 
This Document serves as a guide to enlighten stakeholders about the scope and nature of information that a responsible and well-governed foundation should collect and organize throughout its fiscal year. By delineating plausible auditing and assessment categories, the Document also sets a reference standard for what can and should be responsibly conveyed in the requested Comprehensive Annual Reports. 

2. 	USAGE AND FUNCTION 
This Document serves as: 

2.1 	Comprehensive Framework: A reference outlining elements for Comprehensive Annual Reports, including: 
    ● Areas covered in "ordinary audits" under Swiss standards 
    ● Additional elements for a holistic view of operations and accountability 

2.2 	Transparency Instrument: A guide to help the ICF structure its transparency efforts and educate stakeholders on relevant breadth and depth of foundation activities. 

2.3 	Compliance Checklist: A tool for the ICF to ensure comprehensive coverage in their reports. 

2.4 	Stakeholder Reference: A guide for stakeholders to understand the foundation's operational scope and where impact can be qualitatively and quantifiably measured via audits and other third-party assessments. The range of plausible activities and assessment areas are generated in consideration of functions commonly commensurate with the ICF's non-for-profit purpose type, international purview, and assets on the balance sheet (endowment size). 

2.5 	Audit Scope Clarification: A guideline for the ICF to explain any omissions in their annual audits and outline alternative evaluation measures. 

3. 	ADHERENCE AND IMPLICATIONS
