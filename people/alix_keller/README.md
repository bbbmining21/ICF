## Alix Keller

### Bio
I'm a former Molecular Biologist turned Product Technology Leader, with a whopping 25-year track record in all things software. I've had the pleasure of working with Fortune 100 companies as well as scrappy start-ups, all while maintaining my diplomatic, hilarious, and hard-working demeanor. When I'm not busy challenging the tech industry to “do better” on a global stage, you can find me indulging in my passions for writing sci-fi novels, playing tennis, and jamming out to my own musical creations. As a renaissance woman, I aim to optimize my life to collect great stories while aiming to leave things better then I found them.
